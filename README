Builds of for ReadyNAS on ARM.

These builds are targeted to classic ReadyNAS ARM running RAIDiator 5.3.

As community add-ons are no longer supplied by Netgear, these builds
allow running newer versions of open source software compiled
using the ReadyNAS SDK 3.3, and installed using headers/libraries
compiled from the ReadyNAS GPL tarballs.

The ARM SDK and GPL source files where obtained from:

http://www.readynas.com/download/GPL/index.php

SDK (eg. sdk3.3-ct-ng-1.4.1-arm-mv5sft-linux-gnueabi-1535-25-01-2011.tar.bz2)
should be installed in /opt/sdk.  Then follow the installation instructions in
/opt/sdk/README-SDK.html.

Native ARM filesystem (eg. sdk3.3-genericfs-arm-mv5sft.tar.bz2) should
be extracted to /opt/sdk/targets/arm-mv5sft-linux-gnueabi/rootfs-native

Depedencies can be built using the script scripts/build.  See the README
in scripts for how to setup and run the script.

Binary tarballs can be found in directories named for the software.
