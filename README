Builds of for ReadyNAS on ARM.

These builds are targeted to classic ReadyNAS ARM running RAIDiator 5.3.

As community add-ons are no longer supplied by Netgear, these builds
allow running newer versions of open source software compiled
using the ReadyNAS SDK 3.3, and installed using headers/libraries
compiled from the ReadyNAS GPL tarballs.

The ARM SDK and GPL source files where obtained from:

http://www.readynas.com/download/GPL/index.php

SDK (eg. sdk3.3-ct-ng-1.4.1-arm-mv5sft-linux-gnueabi-1535-25-01-2011.tar.bz2)
should be installed in /opt/sdk.  Then follow the installation instructions in
/opt/sdk/README-SDK.html.

Native ARM filesystem (eg. sdk3.3-genericfs-arm-mv5sft.tar.bz2) should
be extracted to /opt/sdk/targets/arm-mv5sft-linux-gnueabi/rootfs-native

Depedencies can be built using the script scripts/build.  See the README
in scripts for how to setup and run the script.

ReadyNAS Add-on Development

The Netgear Add-on SDK is only available from the Internet Archive.
A description of how to use the SDK can be found at:

https://web.archive.org/web/20150912002632/http://www.readynas.com/?p=346

The actual SDK files can be downloaded from:

https://web.archive.org/web/20150912002632/http://www.readynas.com/download/addons/addons_sdk.tgz

There's also a script to use the SDK to build add-ons: scripts/build-addon

NOTE: the SDK bin/build_addon needs to be patched to use fakeroot and
allow building addons outside the SDK directory. The patch is in
patches/addon-sdk.patch, so use:

cd {addon-sdk-directory}
patch -p1 < {path-to-addon-sdk.patch}

There's also a (optional) patch I created for the templates in
patches/addon-sdk-template.patch
