Builds for Samba v3.x for ReadyNAS ARM platform.

See ../README for sources of the SDK and dependent libraries.

Release Tarballs

Cross-compilation was performed on the supported platform of Ubuntu 8.04
(in a Virtual Machine).

Target was arm-mv5sft-linux-gnueabi (using the SDK build tools).

Many configuration tests that could not be performed on Ubuntu were
compiled and run on an existing ReadyNAS NV+ v2 (to get accurate
results), and then supplied to the build in a config.cache file.

The configure parameters were chosen to provide as much of a
"drop-in" replacement for the existing Samba server as possible,
so that the existing Frontview config files could be used.
As configured, only the smbd/nmbd/winbindd binaries need to be replaced.
All other libraries and dependencies are located under /usr/local.

The full configuration used for the Samba compilation are located
in ../scripts/mods/samba3.mod and built with ../scripts/build

Tarball can be extracted at / (binaries are all in usr/local),
then just replace the original binaries in /usr/sbin (as root):

mv /usr/sbin/smbd /usr/sbin/smbd.orig
mv /usr/sbin/nmbd /usr/sbin/nmbd.orig
mv /usr/sbin/winbind /usr/sbin/winbindd.orig
ln -s /usr/local/sbin/smbd /usr/sbin/smbd
ln -s /usr/local/sbin/nmbd /usr/sbin/nmbd
ln -s /usr/local/sbin/winbindd /usr/sbin/winbindd

and then restart the server:

/etc/init.d/samba restart

All the new libraries and loadable modules will load from /usr/local,
but state and configuration should still work from frontview.

Debian Package

The debian package is created by extracting samba-3.6.25.tgz in
samba36-addon, removing the unused etc/ and var/ directories, and
then running (fakeroot) dpkg-deb -b samba36-addon.

The resulting package can be installed on the ReadyNAS using:

dpkg -i samba36-addon.deb

The install scripts will create the symlinks to smbd/nmbd
(described above) on install unless the DISABLE_ACTIVATION=1
environment variable is set.

The symlinks are removed (.orig files are restored if still present)
on package removal.

NOTE: yes, installing to /usr/local is "not good" - but installing
into /usr would conflict with the native smbd, and installing
to /opt would require adding files to /etc/ld.so.conf.d and
the Samba tools would not be in the default PATH... so I'm
breaking the rules to keep things simple ;)

===

ReadyNAS Add-On

The add-on is created using the ReadyNAS Add-On SDK, and will
perform the Debian package install and handle the creation
and removal of the smbd/nmbd symlinks when the Add-On is
enabled or disabled respectively.

In addition, the add-on includes an option to enable/disable
the SMB2 protocol (enabled by default) when the add-on is
active.

You can use the included Makefile for much of the work, and
it will build the Debian package, and create the add-on
(providing samba-3.6.25.tgz is present, and the Add-On SDK
is installed, and patched).
