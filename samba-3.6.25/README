Builds for Samba v3.x for ReadyNAS ARM platform.

See ../README for sources of the SDK and dependent libraries.

Cross-compilation was performed on the supported platform of Ubuntu 8.04
(in a Virtual Machine).

Target was arm-mv5sft-linux-gnueabi (using the SDK build tools).

Many configuration tests that could not be performed on Ubuntu were
compiled and run on an existing ReadyNAS NV+ v2 (to get accurate
results), and then supplied to the build in a config.cache file.

The configure parameters were chosen to provide as much of a
"drop-in" replacement for the existing Samba server as possible,
so that the existing Frontview config files could be used.
As configured, only the smbd/nmbd binaries need to be replaced.  All
other libraries and dependencies are located under /usr/local.

The full configuration used for the Samba compilation are located
in ../scripts/mods/samba3.mod and built with ../scripts/build

Tarball can be extracted at / (binaries are all in usr/local),
then just replace the original binaries in /usr/sbin (as root):

mv /usr/sbin/smbd /usr/sbin/smbd.orig
mv /usr/sbin/nmbd /usr/sbin/nmbd.orig
ln -s /usr/local/sbin/smbd /usr/sbin/smbd
ln -s /usr/local/sbin/nmbd /usr/sbin/nmbd

and then restart the server:

/etc/init.d/samba restart

All the new libraries and loadable modules will load from /usr/local,
but state and configuration should still work from frontview.
